# ai-agents-portfolio

## Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive portfolio of my AI Agent development skills, demonstrating the end-to-end design, orchestration, and evaluation of agentic workflows. I am building and deploying two high-utility agents that bridge the gap between Large Language Models and deterministic business logic.

Key Objectives:
* Tool Orchestration: Integrating LLMs with external APIs and productivity suites (Notion, Zapier, Google Sheets, Todoist, and Google Calendar) to move beyond simple chat interfaces into actionable systems.
* Deterministic Reliability: Implementing a "Calculation Engine" approach where the AI interacts with structured data (Google Sheets) to ensure financial accuracy and eliminate hallucinations.
* Evaluation Discipline: Utilizing a robust logging system in Notion to track "Runs" and "Actions," allowing for groundedness scoring and iterative improvement.
* Security & Governance: Demonstrating a "public-but-gated" deployment model that protects personal data while remaining accessible for professional demonstration.

## Privacy boundary
Personal-only data. No work tools or work data. Live demos are public but gated by passphrase.
